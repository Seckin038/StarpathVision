# Contributing to StarpathVision

Thank you for considering a contribution! This project blends personas and tarot-inspired content using React, TypeScript and the shadcn/ui component library.

## Development Workflow

1. Use `pnpm` for all scripts and dependency management.
2. Keep pages in `src/pages` and reusable components in `src/components`.
3. Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build` before submitting a pull request.
4. Reference or extend persona data in `personae-json` and tarot assets in `public/tarot` when relevant.
5. Update documentation if you add new persona or tarot resources.
6. Use clear commit messages and open descriptive pull requests.

## Submitting Changes

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
- Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.
- Open a pull request describing your changes and linking any relevant persona or tarot references.

We appreciate your help in making StarpathVision grow!
